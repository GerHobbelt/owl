todo
 + UDP support
   + receiving
     - blocking not checked yet in repl owl/io.scm:266
   + sending
     - move prim_connect to sysops
     - add an argument for socket type selection (stream/dgram)
     - sending primop missing c/ovm.c:/receive-udp/
     - sending not defined at owl/io.scm:266
   + add tests after sending and receiving are there
 + Library usage
   + minimum viable version + use in radamsa
 + type tags
   - better documentation of descriptor format to owl/defmac.scm:/ALLOCA/
 + mutability
   + add a thread-based functional mutable object store library
 + interaction
   + owl proof <-> metadata collection
 + R7RS
   + increase compatibility
 + debugging
   + error messages
     + burn some info about functions to bytecode in interpreted mode
 + optimization
   + partial evaluation 
   + known small function inlining 
     + primop inlining should be handled this way
 + regex
   + non-extended regexps could be compiled differently
 + benchmarking
   + add a continuous benchmarking system
   + start collecting data
   + add a full gc 
 + GC
   - allocate large byte vectors via a separate function
   + allow and ignore pointers outside of heap?
 + multiple runtime owl
   + take first step towards this direction via library mode of compiled programs
   + rewrite vs incremental?
